- **Digital Deal Jackets**: Group documents into deal jackets for individual customers.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Ensure secure access and different roles (admin, sales, etc.).
- **Compliance and Security**: Ensure data security and compliance with regulations.
- **Notifications and Alerts**: Notify users of important actions (upload success, errors, etc.).
- **Reports and Analytics**: Generate reports and insights from archived documents.

### 2. Set Up Project Structure
- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI for building user interfaces.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for server-side logic.

##### 3.2.2 Document Listing and Searching

**Add Search and Filter Capabilities in the DocumentList Component**

- Implement search and filter inputs in the DocumentList component.
- Update the frontend to send search and filter queries to the backend.

**Implement Backend Endpoints for Searching and Filtering Documents**

- Create new endpoints in the backend to handle search and filter requests.
- Ensure the endpoints return the filtered list of documents.

##### 3.2.3 Document Details View

**Enhance the DocumentDetail Component to Display More Metadata and Analysis Results**

- Create data models for customers and deal jackets in Cosmos DB.

#### 4.2 Deal Jacket Management
- Implement features to create, view, edit, and delete digital deal jackets.
- Associate documents with specific deal jackets.

### 5. Advanced Features
#### 5.1 User Roles and Permissions
- Implement role-based access control to restrict actions based on user roles.

#### 5.2 Notifications and Alerts
- Integrate with a notification service to alert users of important events.

#### 5.3 Reports and Analytics
- Build analytics dashboards to provide insights from archived documents.

#### 5.4 Compliance and Security
- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
- Implement additional security measures (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit).

### 6. Testing and Quality Assurance
#### 6.1 Unit and Integration Testing
- Write comprehensive tests for both frontend and backend.

#### 6.2 User Acceptance Testing
- Conduct UAT to ensure the application meets user requirements.

### 7. Deployment and Maintenance
#### 7.1 Deployment
- Deploy the application to a cloud provider (e.g., Azure).

#### 7.2 Monitoring and Logging
- Implement monitoring and logging to track application performance and errors.

#### 7.3 Maintenance
- Plan for regular updates and maintenance tasks.
