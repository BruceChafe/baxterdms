# Baxter CRM

Meet Baxter, a streamlined Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application tailored for the React module of Get Coding. Baxter leverages Material-UI (MUI) to provide a responsive and modern user interface, integrates Firebase for secure login functionality, and uses Firestore for real-time data management of customer information.

Our goal is to offer a user-friendly platform that simplifies the management of customer interactions and data.
